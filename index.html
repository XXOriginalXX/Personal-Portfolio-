        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Adithyan, a passionate Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’ve got hands-on experience working with Python and various machine learning techniques. My focus is on building and implementing AI and ML models to solve real-world problems—because let’s be honest, who doesn’t want to teach machines to make decisions for us?</p>
        <p>I’ve developed several interesting projects, including a Face Recognition system and an Adani Stock Price Prediction model, where I applied machine learning algorithms to predict stock trends based on historical data. I’m fascinated by the endless possibilities AI offers, from predictive modeling to automation—and honestly, just making machines do cool stuff.</p>
        <p><b>Although I’m not a front-end or web developer,</b> I’d rather leave that to the experts. I get a little dizzy trying to align divs and position things perfectly. But when it comes to data-driven solutions and building powerful AI models, that’s where I thrive! I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to learn and grow in the world of AI and ML.</p>
